# October 1, 2024 RC Signing Event


The sign-up for appointment times is closed.

You are welcome to drop in anytime between **6:30 PM and 9:15 PM** on Tuesday, and we will work you in as time allows:

<p align="center" style="margin:0;padding-left: 0;"><b>Tuesday, October 1 @ 7pm</b> </p>
<p align="center" style="margin:0;padding-left: 0;"><b>Holy Nativity Anglican Church</b></p>
<p align="center" style="padding-left: 0;"><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/NJ5JtQFouTHuFFLN6">12707 Bonaventure Drive SE</a></p>

Please note that priority will be given to those with scheduled appointments, so there may be a wait. We will have the documents for everyone who has paid or made arrangements to pay at the meeting.

Please remember to bring a photo ID and all parties listed on the land title, including spouses (even if they are not on the title) must be present.

We are also offering **in-home signing** for those who cannot make the meeting.  This option is dependent on the complexity of the paperwork. Please feel free to **[contact us](mailto:info@bonavistarc.com) by 6pm Tuesday**, to notify us you would like to use this option. This will allow us to pull your paperwork rather than returning it to the law firm.

We have some in-home time slots next Thursday and Saturday, please use the link below to select an available time slot:

 We will be opening some additional in-home dates later this month. Stay tuned for the email with the additional dates, for those who notify us they would like this option by 6pm Tuesday.
