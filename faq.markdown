## Restrictive Covenant {#rc}


**Q: What is a Restrictive Covenant?**

* Legally binding agreement that limits the actions of a property owner
* A “property right” which supersedes a land use by-law
* Other Calgary communities also pursuing this option include: Rideau-Roxboro, Kelvin Grove, Chinook Park, Eagle Ridge, Elbow Park, Mayfair-Bel-Aire
* The Restrictive Covenant is then registered on the land title and continues to apply to the lands even after the lands are sold.

**Q: What is the Restrictive Covenant for Lake Bonavista proposing?**

The general goal of the Restrictive Covenant for Lake Bonavista is to maintain the current nature of our community — single-family homes, big trees, quiet/safe streets, …

The Restrictive Covenant: 

  * Restricts lots to *one Single  Detached  Dwelling*  may be  erected on  each  lots. 
  * It does not restrict one  Single  Detached  Dwelling  from  being   built   on  two   contiguous Lots
  * It allows Secondary Suites in the basement or above/in a garage.
  * Applies to the lot for 75 years regardless of who owns the property 
  * It does not restrict renovations to existing homes or tearing down and rebuilding a new residence for your family as long as it is a single family home. These will be Subject to compliance with the City’s building restriction requirements re setbacks, height, etc., you retain the same freedom as you have today in this regard. 

**Q: Has anyone else in Calgary used a RC to override City Zoning?**

Other Calgary communities also pursuing similar RC include: Rideau-Roxboro, Kelvin Grove, Chinook Park, Eagle Ridge, Elbow Park, Mayfair-Bel-Aire

**Q: What does it cost?**

It is $500/homeowner it is approximately a 50/50 split between:
* Legal fees (legal, paralegal, land title fees, community meetings, signings)
* Defence fund (held in trust) for potential challenges by developers

The exact split is dependant on each homeowners specific situation.
