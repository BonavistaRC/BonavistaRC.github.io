against the wishes of the majority of residents of the city they
supposedly represent. A single-family lot could be
redeveloped to accommodate up to 12 families, with 1/2 a
parking spot per unit, no mention of where the new 36 bins
would be placed. This RC initiative would make such
redevelopment very difficult. In order to ask my neighbours
to sign the RC, I need to do so as well. Judging by the
animosity towards this rezoning shown during the meeting at
the rec centre, this gives the community a way to fight
back.”</i><br><b>- Nora B</b></p>

wanted to Iive in this community. We enjoy the wide streets, large lots and weekends at the lake in the summer and winter. We wanted to be
in an area where our child could have a sense of community, similar to what we enjoyed as children. We moved from a nearby
neighbourhood which has many multi-family homes mixed in with single family homes. The difference in the community here versus our
prior neighbourhood is night and day. ... There are parts of the city where increasing density makes sense but for our lake community it does not fit in. We believe having an oasis of
single-family homes with an ever-busier City of Calgary will actually drive these house prices up, not limit an ultimate sale price. If a resource
(like single family homes with large lots) becomes even more rare,”</i><br><b>- Dan T, New Homeowner</b></p>
