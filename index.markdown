This site is dedicated to the initiative to add a Restrictive Covenant to the property titles in Lake Bonavista to protect the character and nature of our community as one of single-family homes with big trees and quiet, safe streets. <a href="../essay">More Information about the rationale behind ths effort was published in the August 2024 Bonavista Bugle</a>

We are a group of concerned community members who have retained legal counsel from [Carbert Waite LLP](https://carbertwaite.com/) to draft the Restrictive Covenant (RC) for property owners of Lake Bonavista. Several information sessions have been held with presentations from our lawyer, [Curtis Marble](https://carbertwaite.com/calgary-lawyers/curtis-marble/) who is also working with several other Calgary communities on their RC initiatives. The following slides are from these information sessions.
