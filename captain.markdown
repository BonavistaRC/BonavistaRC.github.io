## What is a Block Captain?
A Block Captain is a volunteer who acts as a liaison between the RC Committee and residents on their block. Captains help distribute information, gather feedback, and report concerns from their neighbours to the community group. This is particularly important for members of your block who may not be engaged on social media or the internet. You may be the main source of information for these neighbours.

## Your Responsibilities
As a Block Captain, you will:
- Communicate information and action plans to neighbours (distribute flyers, newsletters, and other important communications).
- Build a contact list for your street to maintain communication with the residents on your block via email or phone.
- Help gather feedback from residents and pass it on to the RC Committee.
- Encourage them to [sign up for our mailing list](../mailinglist).
- Distribute and encourage people to display a lawn sign when they sign up. The signs serve as a reminder to others of the initiative and motivate those who are waiting for others to sign as a collective.

5. **Keep it regular**: Plan to check in with your block every few weeks.

## Communication Tips
- Be clear and concise when sharing information.
- Encourage two-way communication: listen to your neighbours and be responsive. We want to respect each person’s individual situation, and your role is to ensure they have the information needed to make an informed decision.
- Use multiple platforms (flyers, email, social media) to reach as many people as possible.
- Keep messages positive and solution-oriented.

The following information is useful to have printed out for people who are unaware of the initiative:

## FAQs
**What should I do if I can't reach a resident on my block?**  
It’s okay! Not everyone will be easily reachable. Leave the information with an invite to contact you in the way you feel comfortable. It’s helpful to try to get their email, if possible, to make future communication more efficient.

**What if I don't have time for a certain task?**  
Let the RC Committee know, and we can arrange for additional help or coverage.

**What are the common questions and answers Block Captains receive?**

- *What does it cost?*
  - $500 / homeowner 
    - ~50% for legal fees (legal, paralegal, land title fees, community meetings, signage) 
    - ~50% for defence fund (held in trust) for potential challenges from developers  

- *I’m not planning to sell, so why should I sign now?*  
   - The RC is currently discounted to $500 as long as we have group sign-ups. Once we no longer have enough people for group sign-ups, joining will be subject to the rates of the lawyer of your choice.  
   - ~50% of the fee is contributed to the defense fund.  
   - It secures your wishes for your heirs, should anything unplanned occur.

- *How does this benefit me if my immediate neighbor does not sign?*  
   - It strengthens the defense fund.  
   - Discourages developers from attempting land assembly (i.e., several lots next to each other for development).

- *This will not happen in Lake Bonavista.*  
   - As of today, we do not have any active development permits for Lake Bonavista, but our neighboring communities do. We have a list of the current applications on the homepage and send out examples as they occur in [our mailing list](../mailinglist).  
   - This can happen here if we don’t act collectively to prevent it.

- *How many people have signed the RC?*  
   - We encourage you to share the general numbers for your street, but do not share specific house numbers, as not everyone wants this information public. Please encourage people to put a sign on their lawn as a display of unity with members of your street.
